#  BioBlaster

**BioBlaster** is a lightweight desktop app for parsing DNA sequence files, running NCBI BLAST queries, and exporting annotated results to Excel.

---

## Features

-  Batch parsing of `.seq` DNA sequence files
-  Automatic NCBI BLAST search for top hit alignment
-  Exports to Excel with quality metrics
-  Intuitive GUI (Tkinter-based)
-  Standalone `.exe` — no Python install required

---

##  How to Use

1. **Run the app** (`.exe` download below)
2. **Select a folder** that contains:
   - A single subfolder containing `.seq` files
   - And a '.xls' .xlsx` (metadata) file inside the same folder 
3. **Click “Start”** — the app:
   - Parses your sequences, analyzing QS and CRL scores 
   - Submits to NCBI BLAST, one at a time, (can be long) avoid midday US time
   - Writes results to Excel reporting Sample Name, Primer, Sequence, Top Hit on NCBI with Accession #, Sequence Length, % Identitity, E - Value
4. The output Excel file opens automatically
